# Gen DB #

This is a very simple repository that only stores my code to answer part 2 of the WattTime assessment. 
In this repository, you'll find:

1. DDL/ - Contains the DDL script (create_foundation_schema.sql) that can initialize the database on any Postgresql server. Tested on AWS RDS.
2. Design/ - Contains both the DBSchema project file (not relevant to the assessment, but helpful) and the HTML5 diagram that DBSchema created, also published [here.](https://ebsproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~533988631/pages/29335127208/Gen-DB+Storage+Architecture)
3. DML/ - Contains queries and views that explore the test data and answers the test use case specified in the instruction document.

> Please read this page where I explain my reasoning on this solution (with architecture diagrams): https://ebsproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~533988631/pages/29335127234/WattTime+Assessment
